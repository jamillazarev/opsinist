# **A released entry is frozen, and the one permitted change is a marked correction** — that is
# `preflight.sh` §1a-bis, and it is a form. What had no form is the other half: a correction lands
# in `CHANGELOG.md`, reaches the site at the next regeneration, and **never reaches the GitHub
# Release**, whose notes were written once at publish time. So the file admits an error and the
# page most people actually read goes on repeating it.
#
# Measured 2026-08-29, when the owner noticed the site showing two correction blocks where the
# release showed one: three releases had drifted this way across the two repositories, every
# missing block dated after its own tag.
#
# This is a REPORT, not a gate: it needs the network and `gh`, so it cannot live in preflight,
# which must run offline. It prints the command that closes each gap; publishing is outward and
# stays the owner's hand.
