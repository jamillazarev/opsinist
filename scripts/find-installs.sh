# Why this exists: "updated all three harnesses" was once reported on a machine that had
# fourteen installs — nine of them symlinks resolving to a directory that did not exist, so the
# skill was wired into nine harnesses and loading in none of them, and two more copies sat on the
# previous version. Every one of those states is silent by construction: a broken symlink fails
# only when followed, a drifted copy announces nothing, and a config mount outlives the path it
# points at. The claim "updated everywhere" is only as good as the list of everywhere, and this
# script generates that list rather than recalling it.

# A clone with modified TRACKED files may not be able to take the route its own row
# recommends — see the measured limits below; untracked files are not the trigger.
# Measured 2026-08-23, on the sibling methodology's Antigravity install rather than this one: a
# release had been delivered there by rsync ON TOP OF a git clone, so `git pull --ff-only` refused
# — permanently, and for every release after — with *"Your local changes to the following files
# would be overwritten"*. The output is the trap: git prints `Aborting` and `Updating <old>..<new>`
# on adjacent lines, so a glance reads it as success while the install sits versions behind.
# Two delivery routes were used on one directory and the second broke the first. Every install
# this script finds here is a plain copy today, where rsync is right — the check is here because
# "today" is the word that dates badly, and because a route nobody verifies is a route nobody has.
